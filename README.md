# WORLD LAID-OFF: SQL and Power BI Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes global layoffs using SQL and Power BI. SQL was used for data extraction, transformation, and analysis, while Power BI was leveraged to create interactive dashboards that visualize key trends. The project aims to provide insights into layoffs across industries, countries, and companies over time.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about global layoffs, including company names, industries, years, and geographic locations. The data was preprocessed in SQL before being visualized in Power BI.

## Key Features
- **Top 10 Companies with the Most Layoffs**
- **Industry-wise Layoff Distribution**
- **Layoffs by Country with Geographic Mapping**
- **Trend Analysis: Total Layoffs per Year**
- **Company-wise Layoff Comparison**

## Key Findings
- **Layoff Trends**: There was a significant spike in layoffs in 2022, followed by a slight decline in 2023.
- **Most Affected Companies**: Google, Meta, and Microsoft had the highest number of layoffs, with Google leading at 12,000.
- **Industry Insights**: Consumer and Retail sectors faced the most layoffs, each contributing over 11% to the total.
- **Geographic Impact**: Layoffs were widespread, with noticeable clusters in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia.

## Recommendations
- **Workforce Planning**: Companies should implement proactive strategies to manage workforce reductions smoothly.
- **Industry Support Programs**: Retail and Consumer sectors may require policy interventions to reduce layoffs.
- **Geographic Workforce Distribution**: Diversifying workforce locations could mitigate the impact of mass layoffs in specific regions.

## Summary
This project highlights major workforce layoff trends from 2020 to 2023, identifying key industries, companies, and regions affected. The insights provided can help businesses and policymakers implement strategies to manage workforce reductions effectively.
